    This file is a list of changes in class phpMultiLang, version 2.0
    in comparison with version 1.0

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    -At first(and, perhaps, is most important thing)-
        is the language files caching support was added for more performance.

        Now You can cahce any file (or some files) of any language
        with its own expire. The caching mechanism will automatically
        checks the expire of cache and owerwrite it,
        or use instead of a language file.

        The caching can be enabled/disabled for each language separately,
        and the expire can be adjusted separately for each language file.

        I think, that is useful option.

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    -Next - is the localization support for each language.
        You can set the locale for any language,
        simply transfer necessary adjustments in the third argument of
        AssignLanguage() method;

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    -Added method GetLocale(). It returns the current locale string, if it has been defined.

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    -Added a correct processing of files with the php.ini directive
        'magic_quotes_runtime' is turned to TRUE;

        The call of the ini_set("magic_quotes_runtime",0) has been removed from a constructor,
        because its no good, when the class for multilanguage support changes the ini. configuration.
        I think...

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    -Algorithms, and internal structure of a class are a little altered
        for more performance, but return compatibility with the previous version
        is kept almost completely except for this:

        - method SetDynamicIndex() has been renamed to GetStringReference()
        - method GetCurrentLanguage() has been renamed to GetLanguage().
        - when the method SetLanguage() has been successfully called,
          you can assign only (array) language sources.
          In the previous version the files also could be assigned this way.

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    -Documentation and the example has been updated for current version.

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    That is all changes, I think.
    If you'll find anything else, please notify me,
    and I will include it in this file immediately.
    :)

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Enjoy.
